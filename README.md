## ✨ Features  

✔ *Collaborative Filtering* – Recommends jobs based on users with similar profiles.  
✔ *Content-Based Filtering* – Uses *TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity* on job descriptions.  
✔ *Large Dataset* – Analyzes a *700MB* job dataset from Kaggle.  
✔ *Customizable* – Easily extendable to new recommendation techniques.

## 📊 Methodology
	
  •	Collaborative Filtering – Finds similar users based on profiles.
	•	Content-Based Filtering – Uses TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity to match job descriptions with user profiles.
	•	Hybrid Approach (Future Work) – Combining both for better accuracy.

## 📌 Results

✅ Accurately recommends jobs to users with similar profiles.
✅ Finds relevant jobs based on job descriptions.
📈 Potential improvements: Hyperparameter tuning, deep learning methods.
